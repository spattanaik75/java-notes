## Java Multithreading Interview Questions

**1. What is the difference between Process and Thread?**

A process is an executing program that consists of its own memory space, resources, and a single thread of execution. It is an independent entity that can be scheduled and managed by the operating system. On the other hand, a thread is a lightweight unit of execution within a process. Multiple threads within a process share the same memory space and resources, allowing for concurrent execution and better resource utilization.

**2. What are the benefits of multi-threaded programming?**

Multi-threaded programming provides several benefits, including:
- **Concurrency:** Multiple threads can execute concurrently, making it possible to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
- **Responsiveness:** By using threads, you can keep a program responsive even when performing time-consuming operations, as other threads can continue executing.
- **Resource sharing:** Threads can share the same memory space, allowing for efficient communication and data sharing between threads.
- **Utilization of multiple processors/cores:** Multi-threading enables the utilization of multiple processors or CPU cores, thereby improving performance on systems with multiple processing units.
- **Simpler program design:** In certain cases, multi-threading can simplify program design by dividing complex tasks into smaller, manageable threads.

**3. What is the difference between user Thread and daemon Thread?**

User threads and daemon threads are two types of threads in Java. The main difference between them is how they affect the termination of a program. User threads are non-daemon threads, which means they prevent the program from terminating as long as any user threads are still active. Daemon threads, on the other hand, are considered "background" threads that do not prevent the program from terminating. If all remaining threads in a program are daemon threads, the program will exit.

**4. How can we create a Thread in Java?**

In Java, you can create a thread by either extending the `Thread` class or implementing the `Runnable` interface. Here are the steps for each approach:

- **Extending the Thread class:**
  1. Create a new class that extends the `Thread` class.
  2. Override the `run()` method in the subclass to define the thread's behavior.
  3. Create an instance of the subclass and call its `start()` method to start the execution of the thread.

- **Implementing the Runnable interface:**
  1. Create a new class that implements the `Runnable` interface.
  2. Implement the `run()` method from the `Runnable` interface to define the thread's behavior.
  3. Create an instance of the class and pass it as an argument to a new `Thread` object.
  4. Call the `start()` method on the `Thread` object to start the execution of the thread.

**5. What are different states in the lifecycle of Thread?**

A thread in Java goes through several states during its lifecycle. The different states are as follows:

- **New:** The thread is created but has not yet started executing.
- **Runnable:** The thread is ready to run, but it may be waiting for the processor to execute it.
- **Running:** The thread is currently executing its code.
- **Blocked/Waiting:** The thread is waiting for a monitor lock to enter a synchronized block or waiting for another thread to perform a specific action.
- **Timed Waiting:** The thread is waiting for a specified amount of time, either by calling `sleep()` or `wait()` methods.
- **Terminated:** The thread has completed its execution and has terminated.

**6. Can we call the run() method of a Thread class?**

Yes, we can call the `run()` method of a `Thread` class directly

, but it will execute the `run()` method in the current thread instead of starting a new thread. To start a new thread and execute the `run()` method in that thread, we need to call the `start()` method of the `Thread` class.

**7. How can we pause the execution of a Thread for a specific time?**

To pause the execution of a thread for a specific time, you can use the `Thread.sleep()` method. This method pauses the execution of the current thread for the specified number of milliseconds. Here's an example:

```java
try {
    Thread.sleep(1000); // Pauses the execution for 1 second (1000 milliseconds)
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    // Handle the exception
}
```

**8. What do you understand about Thread Priority?**

Thread priority is a way to indicate the importance of a thread to the thread scheduler. Threads with higher priority are more likely to be scheduled for execution compared to threads with lower priority. In Java, thread priority is represented by an integer value between 1 and 10, where 1 is the lowest priority and 10 is the highest priority. However, thread priority should not be relied upon as the sole mechanism for synchronization or thread coordination.

**9. What is Thread Scheduler and Time Slicing?**

The thread scheduler is a part of the operating system or the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that decides which thread should run at any given time. It determines the execution order of threads based on their priority and other factors.

Time slicing is a technique used by the thread scheduler to divide the available CPU time among multiple threads. Each thread is allocated a small time slice, and the scheduler switches between threads at regular intervals to give the illusion of concurrent execution.

**10. What is context-switching in multi-threading?**

Context switching is the process of saving the current state of a running thread and restoring the saved state of another thread for execution. When a context switch occurs, the thread scheduler suspends the currently running thread and switches to another thread, allowing it to resume execution from where it was last suspended. Context switching involves saving and restoring the thread's registers, program counter, and stack pointer.

**11. How can we make sure main() is the last thread to finish in a Java Program?**

To ensure that the `main()` method is the last thread to finish in a Java program, you can use the `Thread.join()` method. By calling `join()` on a thread, the current thread waits for the specified thread to terminate before continuing its execution. In the case of the `main()` method, you can call `join()` on the last thread you want to wait for.

**12. How does thread communicate with each other?**

Threads can communicate with each other through shared objects or by using higher-level synchronization constructs. Some common ways for thread communication in Java include:

- **Shared Objects:** Threads can access and modify shared objects to exchange information. Proper synchronization mechanisms, such as locks or `synchronized` blocks/methods, should be used to ensure thread safety.

- **Wait and Notify:** Threads can use the `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` methods to wait for a condition to be met or signal other threads. These methods should be called within a synchronized block on the shared object.

- **Blocking Queues:** Threads can use blocking queues, such as `java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue`, to pass data between them. Blocking queues handle the synchronization internally.

**13. Why thread communication methods wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() are in the Object class?**

The `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` methods are defined in the `java.lang.Object` class because they are fundamental methods

 for thread coordination and synchronization. Since every Java object is a subclass of `Object`, these methods can be used on any object to coordinate threads. Placing these methods in the `Object` class allows them to be available universally for all objects.

**14. Why wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() methods have to be called from a synchronized method or block?**

The `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` methods must be called from within a synchronized method or block because they are used to coordinate access to shared resources among multiple threads. These methods manipulate the intrinsic lock (also known as a monitor) associated with an object. Requiring synchronization ensures that the calling thread owns the lock for the object on which it is invoking these methods. Without synchronization, a thread could invoke these methods on an object without owning the necessary lock, resulting in runtime errors.

**15. Why Thread.sleep() and Thread.yield() methods are static?**

The `Thread.sleep()` and `Thread.yield()` methods are declared as static because they are utility methods that operate on the current thread. These methods provide a convenient way to pause the execution of the current thread (`sleep()`) or voluntarily give up the CPU (`yield()`) for other threads to execute. Since these methods do not operate on a specific thread object, they are static methods of the `Thread` class.

**16. How can we achieve thread safety in Java?**

Thread safety can be achieved in Java by using synchronization mechanisms to control access to shared resources. Some commonly used techniques include:

- **Synchronized Methods:** By declaring methods as `synchronized`, only one thread can execute the synchronized method on a given instance at a time.

- **Synchronized Blocks:** Using `synchronized` blocks, you can specify a block of code that should be executed atomically. Only one thread can enter a synchronized block associated with a specific object at a time.

- **Locks and Conditions:** The `java.util.concurrent.locks` package provides explicit locks and conditions that can be used to synchronize access to shared resources.

- **Atomic Classes:** The `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package provides atomic classes, such as `AtomicInteger` or `AtomicReference`, that allow for atomic operations on shared variables without the need for explicit synchronization.

**17. What is the volatile keyword in Java?**

The `volatile` keyword in Java is used to declare a variable as "volatile," which guarantees that reads and writes to the variable are atomic (i.e., indivisible) and visible to all threads. It ensures that changes made by one thread to the variable are immediately visible to other threads. The `volatile` keyword is primarily used for variables shared among multiple threads to ensure consistent and predictable behavior.

**18. Which is more preferred - Synchronized method or Synchronized block?**

The preference between a synchronized method and a synchronized block depends on the specific requirements and design of the program. Here are some considerations:

- **Synchronized Method:** If the synchronization needs to be applied to the entire method and the method does not need to access different locks within its body, a synchronized method is a simpler and cleaner option.

- **Synchronized Block:** If finer-grained control is required or if only a specific section of the method needs synchronization, a synchronized block can be used. This allows for more flexibility in choosing the object on which to synchronize.

In general, it is recommended to use synchronized blocks when synchronizing on a specific object and synchronized methods when synchronizing the entire method.

**19. How to create a daemon thread in Java?**

To create a daemon thread in Java, you need to set the `daemon` property of the thread before starting it. A daemon thread is a thread that does not prevent the program from terminating if all remaining threads

 are daemon threads. Here's an example:

```java
Thread daemonThread = new Thread(new Runnable() {
    public void run() {
        // Thread's behavior
    }
});

daemonThread.setDaemon(true); // Set the thread as a daemon
daemonThread.start(); // Start the thread
```

**20. What is ThreadLocal?**

`ThreadLocal` is a class in Java that provides thread-local variables. A thread-local variable is a variable that is unique to each thread, and its value is stored and retrieved on a per-thread basis. Each thread accessing a `ThreadLocal` variable has its own independently initialized copy of the variable. This allows you to associate different values with the same `ThreadLocal` variable for each thread.

**21. What is Thread Group? Why is it advised not to use it?**

A thread group in Java is a way to group multiple threads together as a single unit. It provides a convenient way to manage and manipulate a set of related threads. However, it is generally advised not to use thread groups in modern Java applications. Thread groups have limited functionality and are considered an older, less flexible mechanism for thread management. More modern techniques, such as the Executor framework and thread pools, offer better control and management of threads.

**22. What is a Java Thread Dump? How can we get a Java Thread dump of a Program?**

A Java Thread Dump is a snapshot of the current state and information of all threads running in a Java program. It includes information such as thread names, thread states, stack traces, and other diagnostic details. A thread dump is useful for troubleshooting performance issues, deadlocks, or abnormal behavior in a multi-threaded application.

To obtain a thread dump of a Java program, you can use one of the following methods:

- **Sending a Signal:** On Unix-like systems, you can send a `QUIT` signal to the Java process by using the `kill` command. For example:
  ```
  kill -QUIT <pid>
  ```

- **Using Java Tools:** Java provides tools like `jstack` or `jcmd` to generate thread dumps. For example:
  ```
  jstack <pid>
  ```

- **Programmatically:** You can programmatically obtain a thread dump by calling `Thread.getAllStackTraces()`, which returns a `Map<Thread, StackTraceElement[]>` representing the stack traces of all threads.

**23. What is Deadlock? How to analyze and avoid a deadlock situation?**

A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, each waiting for a resource that is held by another thread in the deadlock group. It results in a situation where no thread can proceed, and the program becomes unresponsive.

To analyze and avoid deadlock situations, you can follow these general guidelines:

- **Identify potential deadlock scenarios:** Analyze the code and identify situations where threads may acquire multiple locks and potentially wait indefinitely.

- **Prevent circular wait:** Ensure that threads acquire multiple locks in the same order to avoid circular dependencies.

- **Use timeouts and timeouts with retries:** Instead of waiting indefinitely for a lock, use timeouts and retry mechanisms to handle exceptional conditions.

- **Avoid nested locks:** Minimize the scope of synchronized blocks or methods to reduce the chances of deadlocks.

- **Use thread-safe classes:** Utilize thread-safe classes and synchronization mechanisms provided by the Java API to avoid common pitfalls.

- **Use deadlock detection tools:** There are tools and profilers available that can help detect and analyze deadlock situations in a program.

**24. What is the Java Timer Class? How to schedule a task to run after a specific interval?**

The `java.util.Timer` class in Java provides a simple way to schedule tasks to run at specific time intervals or after a specified

 delay. To schedule a task to run after a specific interval, you can follow these steps:

1. Create an instance of `Timer` class.
2. Create an instance of `TimerTask` or a subclass of `TimerTask` that defines the task to be executed.
3. Use the `Timer.schedule()` method to schedule the task at a specific time interval or delay.

Here's an example that schedules a task to run after a specific interval:

```java
import java.util.Timer;
import java.util.TimerTask;

public class TimerExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Timer timer = new Timer();
        
        TimerTask task = new TimerTask() {
            public void run() {
                // Task logic
            }
        };
        
        long delay = 1000; // Delay in milliseconds
        long interval = 2000; // Interval in milliseconds
        
        timer.schedule(task, delay, interval);
    }
}
```

**25. What is a Thread Pool? How can we create a Thread Pool in Java?**

A thread pool is a collection of pre-initialized threads that are ready to perform tasks. It provides a way to manage and reuse a pool of worker threads, improving the performance and efficiency of multi-threaded applications.

In Java, you can create a thread pool using the `ExecutorService` framework. Here's an example of creating a thread pool:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class ThreadPoolExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a thread pool with a fixed number of threads
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);

        // Submit tasks to the thread pool
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            Runnable task = new MyTask(i);
            executor.submit(task);
        }

        // Shut down the executor when done
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}

class MyTask implements Runnable {
    private final int taskId;

    public MyTask(int taskId) {
        this.taskId = taskId;
    }

    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Task ID : " + taskId + " executed by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
```

**26. What will happen if we don't override the Thread class `run()` method?**

If you don't override the `run()` method of the `Thread` class, the default implementation of `run()` provided by the `Thread` class does nothing. It is an empty method with no code inside it. Therefore, if you don't override `run()`, the thread will start and then immediately terminate without performing any meaningful work.
